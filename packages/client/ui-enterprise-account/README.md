## Use this package

Mount this client plugin with the enterprise account controller. A non-dismissible application overlay observes the reconnect-safe account stream. One click starts login and opens the authorization URL in a separate browser page; the Host owns callback handling and publishes the signed-in state. Standard browsers reserve that page during the click and navigate it when the Host returns the URL. Desktop asks Electron to open the URL in the system browser. A second open button appears only when browser popup policy blocked the reserved page. The settings section displays only sanitized profile data and provides local-first sign-out.

All product copy is owned by the typed English and Chinese dictionaries. Tokens, authorization codes, PKCE material, and raw ID-token claims are absent from the Remote API and browser state.

## Model Experience

None, as the browser surface does not contribute model-visible input.

#### KV Cache effect

No model request prefix changes.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- A browser that blocks the reserved page requires the visible fallback button.
- Organization branding remains a separate client-brand plugin.

### Dev Note

The enterprise OIDC Agent Note owns the decision to compose this UI only in an enterprise profile.
